ðŸš€ FastAPI Project with UV
Today I successfully ran my first FastAPI "Hello World" project using Uvicorn (UV)! With just a few lines of Python code, I created an API that responds with {"Hello": "World"} and supports dynamic routing like /items/{item_id}. FastAPI also provides a built-in /docs page to test your API in real-time. Itâ€™s fast, simple, and great for learning backend development. Highly recommended for Python developers!
